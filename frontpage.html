    <!-- Goal is to have a comic layout of dynamic divs acting like comic book panels.
    Long term goal is to have panels animated coming in as user scrolls down
    in different ways.
    (Vertical setup)
    More modern comics that are online have special animations that add a punch to
    the comic layout and artwork. I also want to utilize animated divs that have
    different colored halftone patterns swirl and mix as they move over one 
    another. The percived overall color would change with movement of the div 
    pieces. This would be on the splash page. -->
